Alonso Quixano, the protagonist of the novel (though he is not given this name until much later in the book), 
is a Hidalgo (member of the lesser Spanish nobility), nearing 50 years of age, living in an unnamed section of 
La Mancha with his niece and housekeeper, as well as a boy who is never heard of again after the first chapter. 
Although Quixano is usually a rational man, his reading in excess books of chivalry has produced the distortion 
of his perception and the wavering of his mental faculties. In keeping with the humoral theory of the time, not 
sleeping adequately — because he was reading — has caused his brain to dry; Quixano's temperament is thus choleric, 
the hot and dry humor. As a result, he is easily given to anger and believes every word of these fictional books 
of chivalry to be true.
